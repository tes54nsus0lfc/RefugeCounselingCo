I have provided therapeutic services in different environments to a variety of populations. This experience includes a community mental health clinic providing low-cost or no-cost individual and group therapy, Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP) working with chronically mentally ill clients and those going through the most difficult times in their life, Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) for both adults and adolescents who need a higher level of care than traditional outpatient therapy, non-public school setting working with children and adolescents with IEPs who are unable to remain in a traditional classroom setting, public school setting as a school therapist to provide social emotional education and individual child therapy, and group practice working with individuals in-person and virtually.</div>\n<div class=\"align-center\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-center\">I was also able to step into the role of a Program Director for a wraparound agency working with Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) and Department of Mental Health (DMH), providing services to foster youth and families. In addition, I also gained experience as the Program Director for a PHP hospital-setting. It was in these leadership roles where I found another passion of mine - providing clinical supervision to the upcoming generation of therapists. </div>\n<div class=\"align-center\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-center\">I truly believe my experiences in the mental health field have led me to this moment of having a private practice, and have given me the ability to help individuals in a unique way. </div>",

I always knew I was going to be a helper of some kind. After deciding on psychology, I went to Vanguard University of Southern California, where I received my Bachelor’s degree in psychology in 2010. I then went on to earn my Master’s of Science in Clinical Psychology in 2015 at Vanguard as well. Even while earning my degrees, I began to work in the mental health field. I also started my own journey in therapy, and felt and saw what a difference insight and healing makes. Then, as I started working towards my hours needed for my license of Marriage and Family Therapy, I dove into the field, and never looked back!</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div>In September of 2024, I decided to open my own practice. After 6 years of licensed experience, 10 years of working as a therapist, and over 12 years of working with those struggling with their mental health, I decided to use my experience in a way that is also sustainable for my health. Each and every role and position I have had the opportunity to be in has taught me so much. About mental health, this field, and myself.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>I am incredibly grateful and excited to be able to get back to direct patient care and see clients one-on-one, in a space where I’ve seen so much healing take place. This work is so rewarding and I consider it a privilege to do this work.</div>\n<p> </p>",

It all depends on your needs, and this will be discussed and revisited throughout treatment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div> </div>\n<h3><strong><em>What can I expect? </em></strong></h3>\n<blockquote><address>A safe, non-judgmental environment to discuss what your problems are, how they are affecting you, and what changes you would like to make.

I have worked with clients from many backgrounds, and only bring faith/spiritual beliefs into the therapeutic space when the client invites it.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3><strong>How do I get started?</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<div>I offer a free 15-minute consultation, so you can simply call, text, or email to schedule a no-obligation phone call to see if I'm the right fit for you.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div> </div>\n<h3><em><strong>How do I know who the right therapist is for me?</strong></em></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Ask yourself the following: Does the therapist list the issues you are struggling with?

Are you okay with their gender, approach to therapy, and mode of therapy (in-person or virtual)?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div> </div>\n<h3><strong><em>Do you take insurance?</em></strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<div>No, I do not.
